<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
In the Web of Things community, the SSN/SOSA ontology, a W3C recommendation, has established itself as a foundational framework for representing semantic sensor networks, modeling sensors, observations, and actuations. However, it lacks explicit representation of transport protocols, limiting semantic interoperability in machine-to-machine communication scenarios. We propose MQTT4SSN as an extension of SSN/SOSA that semantically models the MQTT protocol to address this gap. MQTT4SSN represents MQTT entities such as brokers, clients, control packets, topics, and payload metadata, linking them to SSN/SOSA concepts to enable end-to-end traceability between sensing semantics and communication semantics. The ontology captures heterogeneous payload formats, encodings, and transport metadata, enabling machine-interpretable description and integration of transmitted content. MQTT4SSN represents an extensible and reusable resource that is accessible according to the FAIR principles.
