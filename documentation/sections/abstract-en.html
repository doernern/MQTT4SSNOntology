<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
In the Web of Things community, the SSN/SOSA ontology, a W3C recommendation, has established itself as a foundational framework for representing semantic sensor networks, modeling sensors, observations, and actuations. However, an explicit representation of message protocols is missing, which limits semantic interoperability in machine-to-machine communication scenarios. We propose MQTT4SSN as an extension of SSN/SOSA that semantically models the MQTT protocol to address this gap. If SSN/SOSA is not used, the proposed ontology can also be used independently for the semantic modeling of the MQTT message protocol. MQTT4SSN represents MQTT entities such as brokers, clients, control packets, topics, and payload metadata, linking them to SSN/SOSA concepts to enable end-to-end traceability between sensing semantics and communication semantics. The ontology captures heterogeneous payload formats, encodings, and transport metadata, enabling machine-interpretable description and integration of transmitted content. MQTT4SSN represents an extensible and reusable resource that is accessible according to the FAIR principles and documented as an Ontology Specification Draft.
